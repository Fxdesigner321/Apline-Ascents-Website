      <h3> <u> ABOUT OUR CLIMBS & MOUNTAINEERING SCHOOL </u> </h3>
      <br>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
          <p>
          Our reputation began in the Himalayas and quickly spread to climbs around the globe. Today,
           our guides are recognized as leaders in the international climbing world and act as a resource for climbers,
            publishers and media organizations. The Alpine Ascents Mountaineering School is considered one of the premier
             climbing schools in North America. And we have been repeatedly praised and acknowledged for our expertise by a 
             variety of media sources and industry professionals.
             <br>
             <br>
          All Alpine Ascents expeditions are carefully prepared. This means investigating quality climbs, selecting optimum 
          routes, supplying top-quality provisions, and developing safety programs for each journey. Before departing on any
           expedition, we provide climbers with a wealth of information, and guides are available to answer questions. We
            realize helping climbers achieve personal goals starts well before the climb. We make great effort to be accessible,
             and respond quickly to all phone calls and e-mail inquiries. Unlike many organizations, we plan and lead our own climbs.
              The majority of our team members come from personal recommendations, and many are repeat climbers.
              <br>
              <br>
          Leading cohesive groups is fundamental to our philosophy. Before any member joins our team, we require background
           information on their conditioning, and their climbing/hiking biography. This helps to ascertain whether each climber
            can be a safe team member and allows our guides to organize the most effective groups.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3> <u> INDIVIDUAL ATTENTION </u> </h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            While many companies market their eco-friendliness, we feel business ethics is a more encompassing term and a
             principle against which we test nearly every decision. While businesses are faced with many difficult decisions,
              we believe organizations have a responsibility towards the greater good of the planet and we strive to meet that
               goal. More than the right thing to do, ethical decisions and actions make operating a business like Alpine Ascents 
               even more interesting and satisfying. It also helps us develop like-minded climbers who share similar values.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3> <u> BUSINESS ETHICS </u> </h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            Whether you are attending our Mountaineering School, climbing with us to the summit of Everest, trekking in the Himalayas or 
            climbing in Antarctica, we feel that personal attention, and prompt and courteous responses,are of utmost importance. Gear, 
            locations, fitness levels, and in-country knowledge are crucial elements in preparing for a trip, and we treat every correspondence
             with utmost care and consideration.
<br>
<br>
            We have always felt that personal attention is an integral part of putting together team-oriented expeditions. We understand that
             being a premier mountaineering company is not only about offering quality services, but about helping each individual achieve 
             their personal goals.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3> <u> CLIMBING AS EXPLORATION </u> </h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            Climbers are indeed modern-day explorers with particular dreams and visions. We look to carry the rhythm of exploration by 
            highlighting not only our climbs, treks and courses, but the overall experience of these journeys. Whether attending our 
            mountaineering school, trekking in the Himalayas or attempting an 8000m peak, we treat each expedition as a unique exploration. 
            We realize that every team member is an adventurer in his or her own right, and joins us to embrace a challenge and to learn
             through experience. We encourage you to visit our website to gather additional information about each expedition.

          <h6> <u> MISSION STATEMENT </u> </h6>
        <br>
        <p>
          Alpine Ascents is committed to developing safe, self-reliant and environmentally-conscious mountaineers, and offering
           courses and expeditions of unsurpassed quality throughout the world. Our business practices stress ethical and culturally aware travel.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h6> <u> MOUNT RAINIER AWARD </u> </h6>
        <br>
        <p>
          In 2006, Alpine Ascents was awarded a highly coveted guiding concession on Mt. Rainier. This prestigious honor was granted to 
          Alpine Ascents based on our:

          <ol>safety record</ol>
          <ol>environmental leadership</ol>
          <ol>quality of services</ol>
          <ol>the experience and qualifications of our guide staff.</ol>
          <br>
          We are honored to have the privilege of guiding such a beautiful peak.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h6> <u> SAFETY RECORD </u> </h6>
        <br>
        <p>
          Our safety record stands as the finest in the guiding industry. This is not simply a promotional statement but a testament to 
          our conservative nature when it comes to decision-making. While mountaineering has inherent risks, our route planning,
           camp selection, student instruction and leadership training starts with a concern for the well-being of climbers. 
           This holds true for both the mountaineering school and expedition climbing. When making decisions and organizing climbs,
            avoiding injury and sickness is our primary focus. At each program’s conclusion, our prevention program is reviewed and
             updated. Climber and guide recommendations are implemented as well, as we constantly update our injury prevention program.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h6> <u> WHAT WE EXPECT </u> </h6>
        <br>
        <p>
          Though our courses and expeditions vary in difficulty and skill level, we expect participants to have a positive attitude, 
          and to be physically and mentally prepared for the demands of the journey. We take the “team effort “idea seriously,
           and presume each climber shares our passion for mountains, cultures and environmental issues.
